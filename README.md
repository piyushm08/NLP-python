# NLP with python
NLP toolkit - Sentiment analysis and predictions based on reviews from amazon, yelp and imdb data sources.

## Task description
Here, the goal is to predict sentiment -- the emotional intent behind a statement -- from text. For example, the sentence: "This movie was terrible!" has a negative sentiment, whereas "loved this cinematic masterpiece" has a positive sentiment.

To simplify the task, consider sentiment binary: labels of 1 indicate a sentence has a positive sentiment, and labels of 0 indicate that the sentence has a negative sentiment.

## Dataset
The dataset is split across three files, representing three different sources -- Amazon, Yelp and IMDB. Task here is to build a sentiment analysis and predictions model using both the Yelp and IMDB data as your training data, and Amazon as a test data.
